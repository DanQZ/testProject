# Clairvoyance

CLAIRVOYANCE is a 2D PvE roguelike fighting game where you can see one second into the future. This allows the player to feasibly battle large groups of enemies at once, and plan their moves instead of relying purely on reactions and remembering attack patterns.

It will be released for free on PC.

Clairvoyance's fighting styles are based off real martial arts. The finished game will have multiple fighting styles based off multiple different martial arts.

Currently, the planned fighting style is a singular moveset, a loose combination of Muay Thai and TKD and a collection of extra moves. If time and motivation permits, Muay Thai, TKD, Wing Chun, and possibly more will be added as individual fighting styles. In that case, you start with one fighting style, and more will be unlocked through various methods. 

The controls involve moving left and right, and moving your head, which lets you dodge attacks and also decides which attack you do.

Moves are decided not by directional input like most fighting games, but instead will be chosen based off the position of your fighter. Some moves can only start their animation in one position and end in another. This makes it faster to transition to some moves and slower to transition to others, like in real life.
